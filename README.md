Shopkeep assessment

Note:
There are some lines in the code that jump out of the ipad layout screen to the bird's eye view and then back to the ipad layout. I was having issues with my configuration here, it was stalling when logging in. I left these lines in for myself to make sure the runs would complete.

Other items:
- If time to refactor:
  - Setup an Object Map for variables, this way constants are used in the code and changes are only made in one place
  - Setup an External methods class so that methods that are duplicated are called instead of being written again. 
  - Tighten up comments to be more detailed and meaningful for better readability.
  - Remove println statement when code is production ready. I added these for my own tracking when code was executing
  
 
Notes:
- If there are no results to display, should 'No results' be displayed for empty searches or invalid searches?

- Are the list items draggable and able to be repositioned? That does not seem to work here.

- Are page names allowed to be duplicated? (i.e.: Create a new page with same name as page that already exists). OR Rename an existing page to a page name that already exists.
